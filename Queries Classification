Testing Queries (Based on the Bot answers):

We have worked on catalog queries, found in the file  "pairs.py" and classified them into four levels:

Level 1: Easy - Approximately the exact same code.
Level 2: Medium - More than 50% of lines are the same.
Level 3: Hard - Less than 50% similarity but with the same functionality.
Level 4: Undetermined - Sometimes the bot provides code (not necessarly correct), sometimes not.
