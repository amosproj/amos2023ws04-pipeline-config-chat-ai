## Project Mission 
This project is to develop a chat AI based user interface for the description and configuration of
RTDIP data pipelines. Users are to interact with the chat AI to create an RTDIP configuration,
consisting of a block configuration (the steps in the pipeline) and PySpark code for individual
blocks to perform the data processing. Chat history and generated output should be visible to the user in parallel, e.g. chat history to the left, generated code to the right.
